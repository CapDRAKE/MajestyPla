Here is a list of what we have to do :
--------------------------------------

    + Choose and add a license
      (Aur√©lien suggest the GPLv3 a popular free (as in freedom) license)
    + Make the documentation
    + Make the architecture
    + and a lot more !!!
    ? Use unity?
    ? C#/C++/C/JAVA ?

Things we have to keep in mind :
--------------------------------

    + Develop the game for Windows in the first place, but don't forget that we
      will port it to Linux and MacOS later
    + Make the game modular in order to make the game cross-platform
    + For the libraries, keep in mind cross-platform
