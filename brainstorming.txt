      example) and the modes CPT and CPAPT
    + Allow to have a sportive multipla
    + Add the 50's multipla as an easter egg
    
    Differents Gear boxes
    Differents Engines
    FWD & AWD & RWD versions
    Race clutch or Road clutch
    
    Allow parts to be removed to lighten the car
    
    Allow to Remove tires
    Allow to put bycicle wheels
    Allow to remove Exhausts to make NOIIISE
